1. Not all fields can be updated after creation. So, if a pod definition has to be updated, delete the pod and re-create.
2. Refer pod spec for more spec details.
3. To create pods ->

   		kubectl create -f <pod definition yaml file>
   
4. To debug pods ->

		 kubectl get pods
		 kubectl describe pods <pod name>
		 kubectl logs <podname> 
	
5. To debug containers in a pod ->

		 kubectl logs <podname> <container name>
